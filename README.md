# Flu-Infection-Rate-Forecast 

Center for Disease Control (CDC) is concerned about ways to forecast the percentage of patients it sees with an influenza-like illness (ILI). I am given with weekly ILI(WILI) percentage records of 10 years and 29 weeks. This data set is composed of three components: week, season and WILI. WILI is the weekly value of the percentage of patients with an influenza-like illness across the US population. Week and season show the underlying week of each WILI value.
